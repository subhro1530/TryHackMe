****** A cheers to our IT department ******
 Tuesday, December 31, 2019

During our hard times our beloved admin managed to save our business by
redesigning the entire website.
As we all around here knows how much I love writing poems I decided to write
one about him:
Born on a Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,
Took ill on Thursday,
Grew worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday,
Buried on Sunday.
That was the endâ¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
